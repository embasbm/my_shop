## REVIEW

These are some points the reviewers have sent to me out of the reviews:

* Code style is not good: the `retrieve_product_for()` is very long a very complex.

* Doesn't follow S.O.L.I.D principles:

  ** The Checkout class is the only one with code, the responsibilities of the code aren't well separated between Product and PricingRule.

* Test support is very limited.

* ~~Rails application is not needed~~
